   <h1 class="abt" id="abtus">About Us</h1>
<p>In the last 20 years, the Internet has grown from being nearly non-existent into the largest,
     most accessible database of information ever created. It has changed the way people communicate, 
     shop, socialise, do business and think about knowledge and learning. Much more than just a new twist on 
     distance learning, online schooling is changing the face of traditional classrooms and making education 
     more accessible than ever before.<br>


    Online education is a form of education where students use their home computers through the internet. F
    or many nontraditional students, among them all those who want to continue working full time or raising f
    amilies, online graduations and courses have become popular in the past decade. Often online graduation and
     course programmes, some of which are conducted using digital technologies, are provided via the online lear
     ning portal of the host university.<br>

     From this simple deﬁnition comes an almost inﬁnite number of ways to teach and learn 
     outside of traditional classrooms and away from college campuses. With online education, students
      can turn anywhere with Internet access and electricity into a classroom. It can include audio, video, 
      text, animations, virtual training environments and live chats with professors. It’s a rich learning envi
      ronment with much more ﬂexibility than a traditional classroom.<br>

When used to its full potential, online education has been shown to be more effective than pure face-to-face
 instruction. It can be engaging, fun and tailored to ﬁt almost anyone’s schedule.<br>
